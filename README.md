# Grmilica - Social Media Application

## Project Description

**Category**: Social Media

Going out tonight? Check the Grmilica app before you do. The place you’re heading to might be dull tonight. With Grmilica, see real-time posts tagging places in your area that either seem unexciting or are labeled with the magical “Grmi” tag. Personalize your posts to let others know what kind of vibe to expect.

Traveling? Allow the app to track your location and discover where the party is happening. Depending on the country, the "Grmi" term may be translated (e.g., "Lit" in American English or "Saoco" in Puerto Rican Spanish). The app also offers a slang dictionary to help users bond with locals. This app is culturally adaptive, offering features tailored to each location’s slang and trends.

## Goals

The goal of Grmilica is to enhance the nightlife experience by providing real-time, user-generated information on local venues. The app focuses on fostering community and cultural adaptation, helping locals and tourists make the most of their nights out. By leveraging user reviews and local culture, Grmilica aims to eliminate bad nights and foster connections between people.
